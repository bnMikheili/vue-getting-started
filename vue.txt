Create & Run app commands
	vue create app_name -d (-d for default)
	npm run serve

Displaying data
	v-on (shortcut - @) Event handler
	v-bind (shortcut - :) One way binding - get as a variable from data (for href, source, image tag)
	v-model Two way binding (get/set variable from data) for input, select, radio/button
	{{data.rame}} interpolation, just display a variable

Displaying lists and conditional content
	v-if add/remove part of the page only if the condition is met (otherwise it's not even generated)
	v-for iterates through lists (it's good to set a :key to identify unique values)
	v-show shows the generated part of the page only if the condition is met

Interacting within a component
	vdata - data model that is used as component data
	vcreated, updated, mounted... (lifecycle hooks) - call functions when DOM is created (e.g. to load data from API)
	asynch with await and Promise - to run function asynchroniously (e.g. to load a data as it needs time)
	vwatch - run a handler function when a variable is changed (put in ''s for instance variable)
	vfilter - add filter functions and use them before displaying by just adding '|' and filter name on the right of the variable
	vcomputed - compute value with dependencies and if any of them changes it's recomputed

Component communication
	vbase - snippet for a new component
	vprops - it's ussualy better to copy the object in data to keep immutability logic
	.$emit - fire the event and pass argument so whoever watches with handle (this way we can update parent)
	vmixins - merge attributes into the component (it just merges with priority to component attrs,
		but for watch and hooks it runs both(mixed ones first))

Accessing data 
	axios - Promise based (returns a promise) library for http request
	async - encapsulate asynchronous logic 
	try/catch - to check the data
